PyGyat is a Python preprosessor which translates regular Python code into brainrot by replacing certain keywords, operators, and built in functions with iPad kid vocabulary.

Implementation based on [Bython](https://github.com/mathialo/bython).

## Key features

 * Write Python using brainrot terms instead.

 * Run PyGyat files using the `pygyat` command, just like Python.

 * Translate Python files to PyGyat and vice versa.

 * Real Python keywords that have defined PyGyat mappings will not be allowed.

 * Edit your PyGyat code with syntax highlighting with the `vscode-pygyat` extension.

## Code example
![Code Example](https://github.com/shamith09/vscode-pygyat/blob/main/code-example.png?raw=true)
Fibonacci sequence (recursively):
```
bop fib(n):
  chat is this real n twin 0:
    its giving 0
  chat is this real n twin 1:
    its giving 1
  its giving fib(n fanum tax 1) rizz fib(n fanum tax 2)
yap(fib(10))
```
Factorial (recursively):
```
bop fact(n):
   chat is this real n twin 1:
      its giving 1
   its giving fact(n fanum tax 1) * n
yap(fact(5))
```
## Installation

You can install PyGyat directly from PyPI using pip (with or without `-H`, depending on your Python installation):

```
$ pip3 install pygyat
```

If you for some reason want to install it from the git repository you can use `git clone` and do a local install instead:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/shamith09/pygyat.git
$ cd pygyat
$ pip3 install .
```

The git version is sometimes a tiny bit ahead of the PyPI version, but not significantly.

To uninstall, simply run 

```
$ pip3 uninstall pygyat
```

which will undo all the changes.

## Keyword mappings

Below is a table of all of the Python keywords or operators that should be replaced by their corresponding PyGyat keyword. Python keywords that don't have a mapping or aren't in this table can just be used as is. If you want to request that a new mapping be made, please submit a pull request.

## Quick intro

PyGyat works by first translating PyGyat files (suggested file ending: .gyat) into Python-files, and then using Python to run them. You therefore need a working installation of Python for PyGyat to work.


To run a PyGyat program, simply type

```
$ pygyat source.gyat arg1 arg2 ...
```

to run `source.gyat` with arg1, arg2, ... as command line arguments. If you want more details on how to run PyGyat files (flags, etc), type

```
$ pygyat -h
```

to print the built-in help page. You can also consult the man page by typing

```
$ man pygyat
```

PyGyat also includes a translator from Python to PyGyat. This is found via the `py2gyat` command:

```
$ py2gyat test.py
```

This will create a PyGyat file called `test.gyat`. A full explanation of `py2gyat`, is found by typing

```
$ py2gyat -h
```

or by consulting the man page:

```
$ man py2gyat
```

## Structure of the repository

At the moment, PyGyat is written in Python. The git repository is structured into 4 directories:

 * `pygyat` contains a Python package containing the parser and other utilities used by the main script
 * `etc` contains manual pages and other auxillary files
 * `scripts` contains the runnable Python scripts, ie the ones run from the shell
 * `testcases` contains a couple of sample \*.gyat and \*.py files intended for testing the implementation
 * [`vscode-pygyat`](https://github.com/shamith09/vscode-pygyat) contains the Visual Studio Code extension that enables syntax highlighting in VS Code.
